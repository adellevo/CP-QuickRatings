# PolyRatings Chrome Extension

[Get the extension here](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/polyratings/pliinobghndmnnjenolmokefjacnmdpo?hl=en&authuser=1)

**How it Works:** Open up Student Center and either click "Search for Classes" or "Enroll" to activate the extension. While looking through classes, hover over any professor highlighted in green to bring up a popup that displays their rating data pulled straight from PolyRatings. Click the “View on PolyRatings” button to go directly to their PolyRatings page, where you can read full reviews. Professors without a PolyRatings page will not be highlighted in green. If a class is taught by multiple professors, it may take a few seconds for the popups to fully initialize. 

**Other Notes:** This extension is in active development. If you encounter any issues, please let us know by emailing us directly at polyratings.ce@gmail.com or submitting feedback through this [Google Form](https://forms.gle/BE3mTCXdY2LNYvLB6).
