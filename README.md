Open up Student Center and either click "Search for Classes" or "Enroll" to activate the extension. While looking through classes, hover over any professor highlighted in green to bring up a popup that displays their rating data pulled straight from PolyRatings. Click the “View on PolyRatings” button to go directly to their PolyRatings page, where you can read full reviews. Professors without a PolyRatings page will not be highlighted in green. If a class is taught by multiple professors, it may take a few seconds for the popups to fully initialize.

This extension is in active development. If you encounter any issues, please let us know by submitting feedback through this Google Form: https://forms.gle/BE3mTCXdY2LNYvLB6.

The official PolyRatings site has been in read-only mode for a few years now, and we plan on addressing this issue in our next release by having an option to add new ratings. There are restrictions surrounding the use of data from RateMyProfessor, so be sure to submit any of your new reviews through this Google Form: https://forms.gle/obZWXWj6UbaGj7jH8. It’s linked directly to our database, which is where we’ll be pulling information from in the future.
