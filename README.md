# Polyratings Chrome Extension (3.0)

### How it works

To activate the extension, [install](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/Polyratings/pliinobghndmnnjenolmokefjacnmdpo?hl=en&authuser=1) it, and log into Student Center. Once you've enabled the extension, you will see that some professors' names are highlighted in green, which indicates that they have existing Polyratings data. Hovering over any highlighted name will trigger a popup that displays an overview of the corresponding professor's ratings, as well as a button to visit that professor's Polyratings page, where you can read full reviews.

#### Viewing classes through the "Search for Classes" or "Enroll" filters

#### Viewing classes on Schedule Builder
When a course is taught by multiple professors, hovering over a highlighted name on the unexpanded dropdown will only trigger a popup if the first professor has Polyratings data. Expanding the dropdown will allow you to access the other professors' data.
