# Polyratings Chrome Extension (3.0)

### How it works

To activate the extension, [install](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/Polyratings/pliinobghndmnnjenolmokefjacnmdpo?hl=en&authuser=1) it and log into Student Center.

#### Using the extension

You will see that some professors' names are highlighted in green, which indicates that they have existing Polyratings data. Hovering over any highlighted name will trigger a popup that displays an overview of the corresponding professor's ratings, as well as a button to visit that professor's Polyratings page, where you can read full reviews.
